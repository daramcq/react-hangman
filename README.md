# Hangman in React
Hangman written in React.

# Setup
Run `./build.sh` to build the app into a container and run `start.sh` to get it running at `localhost:3000`.

## Working
Core game functionality, including:
- A word is chosen randomly
- The user enters letters to make a guess
- Correct guesses are shown clearly
- Wrong guesses are shown
- Remaining lives are displayed through a Hangman graphic

## Improvements Needed
- Unit tests to confirm functionality
- Sound effects would be nice
- Improve messaging to respond to actions
