# Hangman in React
Writing Hangman in React to get to grip with the basics.

## Working
Core game functionality, including:
- A word is chosen randomly
- The user enters letters to make a guess
- Correct guesses are shown clearly
- Wrong guesses are shown
- Remaining lives are displayed through a Hangman graphic

## Improvements Needed
- User should be able to enter guesses without clicking on an input box
- Unit tests to confirm functionality
- Sound effects would be nice
- Improve messaging to respond to actions
